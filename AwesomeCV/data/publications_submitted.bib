  abstract = {During rollout of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, several jurisdictions extended the interval between the first and second doses to prioritize wider population access to limited vaccine supply. This study evaluated the effects of an extended dose interval on development of antibody and cell-mediated responses following the primary dose series and a subsequent booster dose. An extended dose interval was associated with improved neutralizing antibody responses against both ancestral and early SARS-CoV-2 variants, but not Omicron variants. Dose interval had no impact on the development of antigen-specific memory T cell responses, the memory or T helper phenotypes of responding T cells or cytokine production. Importantly, the effects of the primary dose interval on immune outcomes were no longer evident after a third dose of mRNA vaccine, indicating that the short-term immunological benefits of an extended dose interval are transient in the context of subsequent exposures. However, in addition to the public health benefits of wider population access to COVID-19 vaccines, the short-term immunological benefits of extending the dose interval may have been sustained in the absence of boosters. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dosing intervals during the development of future vaccine candidates.},

  title = {Diagnostic value of serum RPR titre and peripheral CD4 cell count for asymptomatic neurosyphilis in people living with HIV: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol},
  journal = {Systematic Reviews},

  article_type = {Protocol},

  abstract = {Background: Neurosyphilis is a serious complication of syphilis infection, particularly in people living with HIV (PLWH), and classically presents with neurologic symptoms. Whether to perform a diagnostic lumbar puncture in PLWH with syphilis co-infection in the absence of neurologic symptoms remains controversial. Serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and CD4 cell count have been used to assess the risk of asymptomatic neurosyphilis (ANS), but their reliability remains uncertain. We describe a systematic review to determine the diagnostic utility of a high serum RPR titre (≥1:32) and a low CD4 count (≤350 cells/mm3) for detecting ANS in adult PLWH with syphilis coinfection. Methods: This systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‑Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will include studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of serum RPR and CD4 count criteria for neurosyphilis in adults (≥18 years) living with HIV who have lab-confirmed syphilis. Neurosyphilis must be diagnosed via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (a reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test and/or white blood cells >10 cells/mm3). We will search Medline and Embase databases from 1983 (the year in which HIV was first identified) to June 24, 2024, without any restriction on language and region. Case reports, case series (<10 patients), and studies lacking data on true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, will be excluded. Two reviewers will screen articles independently, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Methodological quality and bias risk will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals will be shown in Forest plots. If appropriate, summary sensitivities and specificities for serum RPR ≥1:32 and CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm3 will be obtained via meta-analyses using a bivariate model. Discussion: This systematic review will synthesize existing literature and inform clinical decisions regarding the use of serum RPR and CD4 count in determining the need for lumbar puncture to diagnose ANS in PLWH.},
